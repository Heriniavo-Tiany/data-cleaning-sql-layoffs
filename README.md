# World Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

A full MySQL project covering both data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the global layoffs dataset. This project demonstrates how to clean raw data, standardize it, handle missing values, and extract meaningful business insights using pure SQL.

## Project Scope

- Part 1: Data Cleaning – Standardizing messy, real-world data for effective analysis.  
- Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Uncovering patterns, outliers, and trends in the layoffs.  
- Pure SQL used throughout, including advanced techniques like CTEs and window functions.

- EDA Article: [world-layoffs-eda](https://tiany-sampilahy.framer.website/blog/world-layoffs-eda)

## Technologies Used

- MySQL (Structured Query Language)  
- SQL CTEs, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions  

## Files

- layoffs_staging2.sql: Cleaned dataset used for EDA (not included here)  
- data_cleaning.sql: Queries used for cleaning and transforming the raw dataset  
- eda_queries.sql: Queries for detailed exploratory data analysis  

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Import the CSV dataset into a MySQL database.  
2. Use the queries provided in the SQL files in your preferred SQL IDE (MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.).  
3. Review both articles to understand the reasoning and methods used.
